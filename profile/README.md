## Architecture :desktop_computer: +...+ :desktop_computer:

On Arcology, a node is no longer a single machine but can be a group of interconnected computers with functional modules deployed. All the machines can work collaboratively to share the workload (execution/storage/bandwidth) just like one. The overall throughput is proportional to amount of the resources available.

In case the workload outgrows the resources of a single machine, try the cluster mode.
